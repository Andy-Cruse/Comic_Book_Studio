# Where Should I Build My Comic Book Studio?Â¶
I've always wanted to have my own comic book line, however I cannot draw so I would need to hire multiple people tp do that for me. Thus I need to build a studio, but where is the best place to do that?

In this project, I use the Pushshift Reddit API to search for comments about popular superheros in 58 city-based subreddits to determine where the highest concentration of discussion to lowest subreddit population is.
